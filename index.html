  <center><h1>Web Design: Website Project</h1></center>
  <p>We are starting a new project in CTD3C class. A project about designing and creating a website. The class is divided into smaller groups. We first did some brainstorming about the website we want to create, then we prpoesed our ideas on eaglenet. Then we were divided up into our project groups and look over eaglenet to select a project that we as a group will work on for the future sememster.<p>

    <ul>
      <li>A website to exchange notes, notes exchange center</li>
      <li>Website for online tutorial guide</li>
      <li>Lifehacker</li>
      <li>Website for MUN club</li>
      <li>Website for Prom in AIS</li>
    </ul>
    <p>I personally prefer the idea about creating a website for people to exchange notes on internet, because through internet students could get a lot of help by seeing and learning other peoples' notes that their notes might not include. This provide a platform for students to make up their bad note taking skills or simply they missed a class and they need to make up for the class.</p>

    <center><h2>Pros and Cons about FW, DW</h2></center>
    <h3><ins>Adobe Fireworks</ins></h3>
    <p>A simple and quick to use program. In fireworks most of the work could be done just simply by drag and drop, very easy to use when creating a wireframe and storyboard. Since afterall you are just simply trying to have a clear picture of how you want your website to be. I am very new to the process of designing and using codes and html language. Fireworks is a graphics application, compare to photoshop is lessed complicated, it loads up quickly and fairly easy to pin down your ideas on the computer. Fireworks is very similar with Photoshop in a sense that they both have the layers feature. Which allows you to edit different layer and you could disable them so you could do some changes on the background. You could see the effect that one specific layer bring to the webpage. After you get your ideas down on the computer in order for you to export and create the html file you have to slice up everything. The slicing process is very quick but sometimes due to the optimizing issue you need to optimize it first in your original file. For me when I was slicing up the image, I did not really care that much so in the end the quality became very bad and not the way I wanted. So it would be harder for me to communicate to my client if I was to show my storyboard in a very low quality manner. If you don't take that extra step of slicing the images up, then when you preview it on the browser it is just one big picture if you want to do any last minute change it is very hard to esit since it's just one big picture. In fireworks you don't really need to have a lot of knowledge about html and css to create a wireframe, you could just simply insert picture and work with the font edit that the program already carrys. Fireworks is very good at working with images and graphics for the web, they give you a proper output very time that woyld be suitable for our purpose to publish on the webpage.</p>
    <h4>Advantages</h4>
    <ul>
      <li>No CSS coding</li>
      <li>Drag and drop functions</li>
      <li>Inserting images, suitable for web</li>
      <li>Less complicated than Photoshop</li>
      <li>Better Image Optimization</li>
      <li>Fast to load and work with, smaller file size</li>
      <li>Can export into HTML</li>
      <li>Play with the images and fonts</li>
      <li>Layer functions</li>
      <li>See the big picture get a quick idea of things(easy to turn into prototype)</li>
    </ul>
    <h4>Disadvantages</h4>
    <ul>
      <li>Slice up images</li>
      <li>Hard to edit(small details, fonts), since it's a picture</li>
      <li>Does take extra steps to optimize the image up to the quality you want.</li>
      <li>A lot of bugs in Fireworks, sometimes will crash without reason</li>
    </ul>

    <h3><ins>Adobe Dreamweaver</ins></h3>
    <p>A program that allows you to do more editing with coding. Dreamweaver, more for actual building the website rather than planning. Compared with Fireworks it have more flexibility to edit the page since you could adjust it on the coding side and you could edit it on its design side. The split function in Dreamweaver really helped a lot, while you place the design(inserting boxes) on the file in Dreamweaver it will automatically generate the code on the other side. If you would like to adjust the fonts or the box you could simple just adjust it with your mouse by draging or even better you could just imput the numbers. Which for me it is really helpful, that I can get to do it both way. In Dreamweaver you don't need to remember all those complicated CSS coding, actually you could just select in the tool box rather than typing out the entire code or spend more time on researching. There are no exporting process since you are creating and editing on a HTML file so it is easier to publish and preview it on the browser.</p>

    <h4>Advantages</h4>
    <ul>
      <li>HTML file without export</li>
      <li>Easy to edit with code</li>
      <li>Split design (code and design view)</li>
      <li>Automatically generate the code of placed objects</li>
      <li>Suggest code, you could select for CSS</li>
      <li>Properties bar and inserting tools</li>
      <li>File manager at the side</li>
      <li>Dreamweaver templates function</li>
    </ul>
    <h4>Disadvantages</h4>
    <ul>
      <li>More complicated compared to Fireworks</li>
      <li>Have a lot of bugs</li>
      <li>Don't have full control of your code</li>
      <li>Codes could get very confusing</li>
    </ul>
    <h3><ins>Conclusion</ins></h3>
    <p>After creating a storyboard and a working site from both programs. It is the best to use both of them in a design cycle. They all have their strengths and weaknesses. They helped each other in a sense here. For the planning process I would chose Fireworks over Dreamweaver, it is much better and easier to use Fireworks to see the big picture and to compliement your ideas during the communication process with the clients. Building an actual homepage and putting informtation, it is much better with Dreamweaver because it is made to create html files. Although it might seem complicated to new beginners with a little more time to explore but with the split functions it is very easy to adjust and make changes. You could check yourself if you were incorrect cause it wouldn't show up on the design page. I would say just using only one of the program to build an exceelent website that achives all the objectives would be very difficult. Because our product is built for the client and using Dreamweaver it would be difficult to communicate to the client if they do not understand codes and it would be more difficult to communicate the ideas compared with pen and paper or Fireworks. On the other hand using Fireworks is just like pen and paper to explore and develop your idea. It allows you to develop the idea, show your idea and it would be a very helpful tool to use to communicate with the client. So by using two programs togethe, Fireworks for the planning and communicating then the actual constructing of the website on Dreamweaver it would speed up the design process allowing more feedback and more versions of the product. Different tools under different circumstances allows the design ans the process to make the most out of it.
