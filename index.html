<h3>Brainstorm ideas for project</h3>
<ul>
<li>A website to exchange notes, notes exchange center</li>
<li>Website for online tutorial guide</li>
<li>Lifehacker</li>
<li>Website for MUN club</li>
<li>Website for prom in ais</li>

<p>My favorite ideas out of the most is the note exchanging center,
I feel like it will help students a lot. This provide a platform for
students to make up there note or bad note taking skills.</p>

<h3>Group Project #1</h3>
<p>Out of all the ideas posted on moodle and our own ideas.<p>
<p>Final decision, Minji Math project idea</p>
<p>We decide to make a website for AIS students taking math class</p>
<p>Client: AIS math teachers</p>
<p>Audience: AIS students</p>
<p>Minji emailed Mr.Kang, contact with real client</p>
<p>After contacting with client, client decided that he only wants
the website to focus on trigonometry.</p>
<p>Instead of creating a website for every math section, now we
are only making a website for trig. </p>
<p>Mr. Chiu came and discussed with us, throw in some challenge quetions.</p>
<p>This webpage is to help peole with trigonometry.</p>

<li>FOR students that are struggling with chaper 14, trigonometry TO
understand and study by themselves by quizzes and quick tips.</li>
<li>FOR Mr. Kang (real world client) TO teach his student and help them instead
of creating a moodle page separately.</li>
<li>FOR people outside of the classroom TO learn and understand also to have
access about the trigonometry chapter information.</li>
</ol>

<h3>Group Project #2</h3>
<p>We decide to change a project becuae there are too many problems and the
project start to become very complicated and confusing.</p>
<p>Client: Mr. Leung</p>
</p>We tak to Mr. Leung directly and he would want us to develop a website for
yearbook photography club</p>
<p>Audience: Photographer</p>
<p>The fecebook page for the yearbook, Mr. Leung feel it is not organize and
the page is too long, you have to scroll down forever to find something.</p>
<p>Show good examples and bad ecamples of yearbook pictures</p>
<p>photography lessons, display some yearbook news feed, what is going on in
the yearbook.</p>
<p>Deadline for the assignments.</p>

<p>This website is for the yearbook club, they are the audience of this website.
This website is designed for them to get easy access to the club information
such as the deadline of certain projects, a guide for them to take pictures. Our
client is Mr.Leung </p>

<h3>To-do List</h3>

<h3>Flowcharts/storyboard</h3>
<h4>Ideas<h4/>
<img src="yearbook page  - New Page.jpeg"/>
<h4>Final flowchart<h4/>
<img src="Yearbook Photography Page - New Page.jpeg"/>
<p>We pick this flowchart here because this one compared to the other ones we
made is simpler and does not involve a lot of clicking or going through a lot
of pages or coast some time. It is very stragiht forward that the client and
what we want. To make this website clean and simple. </p>

<h3>Problems</h3>
<ul>
<li>Why would Mr. Kang need this webpage instead of uploading it on moodle?</li>
<li>WHat is the purpose of this page?</li>
<li>How can this help Mr.Kang?</li>
<li>Why would Mr. Leung need a seperate website to display those information?
Why don't he use moodle?</li>

<h1> Evaluation </h1>
<p>We came up with many differnt ideas, we finalized our descision. We are
making a website for Mr. Kang to help him teach trig easier and peole can get
access to the information easier and learn faster.</p>
<p>Mr. chiu have challenged us with differnt questions, and the exact purpose
of this website. Why would Mr. Kang use this page instead of using moodle?</p>
<p>Many quesions and uncertainty we decide to change our topic. Mr. Leung have
provided us with some idea. We especailly wanted to create a website for
yearbook</p>

<h3>pros and cons about FW, DW</h3>
<p>Firework-easy and simple, it's very quick to slice up images and exporting
  them <p>

<h1>Feedback</h1>
<p>clean up, make the navigator 30% to 70%. The page now seem to unbalanced does
  not look good.<p>
<p>Changing the storyboard to a working prototype, use firework slice up
everything you would want to include in the prototype. Then export the sliced
images.</p>
