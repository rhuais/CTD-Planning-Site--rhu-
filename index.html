<h3>Brainstorm ideas for project</h3>
<ul>
<li>A website to exchange notes, notes exchange center</li>
<li>Website for online tutorial guide</li>
<li>Lifehacker</li>
<li>Website for MUN club</li>
<li>Website for prom in ais</li>

<p>My favorite ideas out of the most is the note exchanging center,
I feel like it will help students a lot. This provide a platform for
students to make up there note or bad note taking skills.</p>
