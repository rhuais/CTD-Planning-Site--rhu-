<h3>Brainstorm ideas for project</h3>
<ul>
<li>A website to exchange notes, notes exchange center</li>
<li>Website for online tutorial guide</li>
<li>Lifehacker</li>
<li>Website for MUN club</li>
<li>Website for prom in ais</li>
<p>My favorite ideas out of the most is the note exchanging center,
I feel like it will help students a lot. This provide a platform for
students to make up there note or bad note taking skills.</p>

<h3>Pros and Cons about FW, DW</h3>
<p>Firework-easy and simple, it's very quick to slice up images and exporting
  them. The downside is when editing it is very hard to change a small portion
  of it, the other good thing about firework is I don't relly have to do css
  code to make it look good. Instead I can just insert picture, make a quick
  design.In firework you have to slice up the images which is very qucik, but
  sometimes the webpage don't show up as I originally wanted to. If you don't
  slice up the images then the webpage is a big thing, very hard to edit. <p>

<p>Dreamweaver-quick and fast, not that simple and easy to get your hands on
  compared to Firework. However, in Dreamweaver it's much easier to do the CSS
  design code compared with other program. Other than having to write your own,
  we could just select the code from Dreamweaver. So compared with other
  application I would chose Dreamweaver to write my css code. Also the split
  function showing the code and the design really help. Once you finish editing
  the code you can see the result and change everything quickly. The code is
  an easier way to put things to exact position.For me Dreamweaver takes some
  time to get use to it since it's not only just drag and drop, it haves more
  options it can get more complicated.</p>
