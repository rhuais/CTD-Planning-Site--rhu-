<h3>Group Project #1</h3>
<p>Out of all the ideas posted on moodle and our own ideas.<p>
<p>Final decision, Minji Math project idea</p>
<p>We decide to make a website for AIS students taking math class</p>
<p>Client: AIS math teachers</p>
<p>Audience: AIS students</p>
<p>Minji emailed Mr.Kang, contact with real client</p>
<p>After contacting with client, client decided that he only wants
the website to focus on trigonometry.</p>
<p>Instead of creating a website for every math section, now we
are only making a website for trig. </p>
<p>Mr. Chiu came and discussed with us, throw in some challenge questions.</p>
<p>This webpage is to help people with trigonometry.</p>

<h3>Objectives<h3>
<ol>
<li>Information from teachers</li>
<li>Look interesting, colorful</li>
<li>Font is easy to read, not too big or small</li>
<li>Include a navigation bar on the side, a search bar</li>
<li>New tabs will open when clicking</li>
<li>Viewable online PDF reader</li>
<li>FOR students that are struggling with chapter 14, trigonometry TO
understand and study by themselves by quizzes and quick tips.</li>
<li>FOR Mr. Kang (real world client) TO teach his student and help them instead
of creating a moodle page separately.</li>
<li>FOR people outside of the classroom TO learn and understand also to have
access about the trigonometry chapter information.</li>
</ol>
<h3> Evaluation </h3>
<p>We came up with many different ideas, we finalized our decision. We are
  making a website for Mr. Kang to help him teach trig easier and people can get
  access to the information easier and learn faster.</p>
  <p>Mr. chiu have challenged us with different questions, and the exact purpose
    of this website. Why would Mr. Kang use this page instead of using moodle?</p>
