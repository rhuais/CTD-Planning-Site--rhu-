  <h3><ins>Decision</ins></h3>
  <p>We were diivided into smaller groups, Minji, Kowk and me were divided into one group. After careful consideration and discussion by looking through all the ideas posted on Moodle we all agree to work on Minji's Math project. We think that this website have a clear purpose with a good audience. This website also have an actual real life client-Mr. Kang which would be much easier to work for. With a clear outline of MAP (Message, Audience, Purpose) we figure it is a much better project to work together, also if it was successful it would be very useful and helpful as a learning tool for the math department ans students.</p>
  <h3><ins>What?</ins></h3>
  <p>The project is about making a website for AIS student that focus on teaching important concepts about math in particular. Originally we were thinking about creating a website that covers the entire textbook, it would have teacher resources,extra worksheets and lessons to help students. Something similar to the on-line textbook, yet only exclusive at AIS. Our real life client is Mr. Kang in AIS, and the we are targeting the students currently taking wither Algebra 2, 3 and pre-calculus. After contacting the client through e-mail, the client wants this website to be made sepcifically for trignometry unit. The website aims to help people have a better time to learn math and an extra tool provided for them to improve.</p>

  <h3><ins>Objectives and Criteria</ins></h3>
  <ul>
    <li>Website look interesting, colorful</li>
    <li>Font is easy to read, not too big or small</li>
    <li>Include a navigation bar on the side, a search bar</li>
    <li>New tabs will open when clicking</li>
    <li>Viewable online PDF reader</li>
    <li>FOR students that are struggling with chapter 14, trigonometry TO
    understand and study by themselves by quizzes and quick tips.</li>
    <li>FOR Mr. Kang (real world client) TO teach his student and help them instead
    of creating a moodle page separately.</li>
    <li>FOR people outside of the classroom TO learn and understand also to have
    access about the trigonometry chapter information.</li>
  </ul>
  <h3><ins>To-Do List</ins></h3>
  <ul>
    <li>Textbook information from teacher, access</li>
    <li>Divide the information into different section</li>
    <li>Wireframe the pages</li>
  </ul>
  <h3><ins>Problems</ins></h3>
  <ul>
    <li>Why would Mr. Kang need this webpage instead of uploading it on moodle?</li>
    <li>What is the purpose of this page?</li>
    <li>How can this help Mr. Kang?</li>
  </ul>
  <h3><ins>Evaluation</ins></h3>
  <p>With many problems and rethink it over agian the purpose of this website was good. The intention was good, however, it is not neccessary to create a new seperate website dedicated to trigonometry that the online textbook already cover. With many different ideas and discussion we decide to change our website project to develope a website for the yearbook club.We did not carfully think through everything and did not fully understand the clients need till later. We have our own opinion and stand which ignored the desire and needs of the client and the audience. Too much about how "we" want the website to be and look rather than listening to the client abd thinking for the audience and purpose.</p>
