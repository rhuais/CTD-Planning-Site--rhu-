<p>We decide to use this flowchart because this one is much simpler and easier to follow. It does not involove a lot of clicking or going through a lot of pages. It is very simple and straight forward. The client wants the website to be simple and easy to have access, so this flowchart allows us to work towards simplicity. The website mainpage serves for two purpose, one for the audience, which in our
  case are the students in yearbook photography team to go on the website to check
  for their deadlines and assignments on the website. Originally we used many shapes, colors and fonts to make the flowchart. However along with many shapes. colors
  and fonts the flowchart became confusing and does not show the clear flow of
  the website. So we recreate and reorganize the flowchart, Mr.Chiu gives some
  suggestion for the flowcharts including using a simple shape that does not
  indicate any meaning.</p>
