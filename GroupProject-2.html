<h3>Group Project #2</h3>
<p>We decide to change a project because there are too many problems and the
project start to become very complicated and confusing.</p>
<p>Client: Mr. Leung</p>
</p>We tak to Mr. Leung directly and he would want us to develop a website for
yearbook photography club</p>
<p>Audience: Photographer</p>
<p>The facebook page for the yearbook, Mr. Leung feel it is not organize and
the page is too long, you have to scroll down forever to find something.</p>
<p>Show good examples and bad examples of yearbook pictures</p>
<p>photography lessons, display some yearbook news feed, what is going on in
the yearbook.</p>
<p>Deadline for the assignments.</p>

<h3>Objectives</h3>
<ol>
<li>FOR Mr.Leung (real life client) TO inform the deadline and his expectations
for the photos.</li>
<li>FOR photographers in the yearbook club TO learn how to take good photos.</li>

<h3>Success criteria<h3/>
<img src="docs/other pics/success criteria.png"/>

<p>This website is for the yearbook club, they are the audience of this website.
This website is designed for them to get easy access to the club information
such as the deadline of certain projects, a guide for them to take pictures. Our
client is Mr.Leung </p>

<h3>To-do List</h3>

<h4>Ideas<h4/>

<h4>Final flowchart<h4/>
<img src="docs/other pics/"/>
<p>We pick this flowchart here because this one compared to the other ones we
made is simpler and does not involve a lot of clicking or going through a lot
of pages or coast some time. It is very straight forward that the client and
what we want. To make this website clean and simple. </p>

<h3>Problems</h3>
<ul>
<li>Why would Mr. Leung need a separate website to display those information?
Why don't he use moodle?</li>

<h3>Evaluation</h3>
<p>Many questions and uncertainty we decide to change our topic. Mr. Leung have
provided us with some idea. We want to create a website for
yearbook</p>

<h1>Feedback</h1>
<p>clean up, make the navigator 30% to 70%. The page now seem to unbalanced, does
  not look good.<p>
  <p>Changing the storyboard to a working prototype, use firework slice up
  everything you would want to include in the prototype. Then export the sliced
  images.</p>
