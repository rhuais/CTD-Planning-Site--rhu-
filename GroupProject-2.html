<h3>Group Project #2</h3>
<p>We decide to change a project because there are too many problems and the
project start to become very complicated and confusing.</p>
<p>Client: Mr. Leung</p>
</p>We tak to Mr. Leung directly and he would want us to develop a website for
yearbook photography club</p>
<p>Audience: Photographer</p>
<p>The facebook page for the yearbook, Mr. Leung feel it is not organize and
the page is too long, you have to scroll down forever to find something.</p>
<p>Show good examples and bad examples of yearbook pictures</p>
<p>photography lessons, display some yearbook news feed, what is going on in
the yearbook.</p>
<p>Deadline for the assignments.</p>
<h3>Objectives</h3>
<ol>
<li>FOR Mr.Leung (real life client) TO inform the deadline and his expectations
for the photos.</li>
<li>FOR photographers in the yearbook club TO learn how to take good photos.</li>

<p>This website is for the yearbook club, they are the audience of this website.
This website is designed for them to get easy access to the club information
such as the deadline of certain projects, a guide for them to take pictures. Our
client is Mr.Leung </p>

<h3>To-do List</h3>

<h4>Final flowchart<h4/>
<img src="docs/other pics/flowchart final.png"/>
<p>We pick this flowchart here because this one compared to the other ones we
made is simpler and does not involve a lot of clicking or going through a lot
of pages or coast some time. It is very straight forward that the client and
what we want. To make this website clean and simple. </p>

<p>The website mainpage serves fro two purpose one for the audience which in our
case are the students in yearbook photography team to go on the website to check
for their deadlines and assignments on the website. Originally we used many shapes,
colors and fonts to make the flowchart. However along with many shapes. colors
and fonts the flowchart became confusing and does don't show the clear flow of
the website. So we recreate and reorganize the flowchart, Mr.Chiu gives some
suggestion for the flowcharts including using a simple shape that does not
indicate any meaning.</p>
<h3>Problems</h3>
<ul>
<li>Why would Mr. Leung need a separate website to display those information?
Why don't he use moodle?</li>
<li>How to construct a prototype on Dreamweaver?</li>
<li>How to make a link on the planning site to pop up on a separate tab?</li>
<h3>Evaluation</h3>
<p>Many questions and uncertainty we decide to change our topic. Mr. Leung have
provided us with some idea. We want to create a website for
yearbook</p>
<p>Our previous success criteria is too vague not measuring the detail of the project,
  the criteria does not follow the SMART principle.</p>
<h1>Feedback</h1>
<p>Clean up, make the navigator 30% to 70%. The page now seem to unbalanced, does
  not look good. The page seem very complicated.<p>
  <p>Changing the storyboard to a working prototype, use firework slice up
  everything you would want to include in the prototype. Then export the sliced
  images.</p>
  <p>Change the flowcahrt we origihnally have, make it look more organized and less
  distracted by the fonts, colors and different shapes.</p>
