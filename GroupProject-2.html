<h3>Group Project #2</h3>
<p>We decide to change a project because there are too many problems and the
project start to become very complicated and confusing.</p>
<p>Client: Mr. Leung</p>
</p>We tak to Mr. Leung directly and he would want us to develop a website for
yearbook photography club</p>
<p>Audience: Photographer</p>
<p>The facebook page for the yearbook, Mr. Leung feel it is not organize and
the page is too long, you have to scroll down forever to find something.</p>
<p>Show good examples and bad examples of yearbook pictures</p>
<p>photography lessons, display some yearbook news feed, what is going on in
the yearbook.</p>
<p>Deadline for the assignments.</p>

<h3>Objectives</h3>
<ol>
<li>Include a navigator bar on the side, a search bar.</li>
<li>Include a timeline of some sort to display the deadline information.</li>
<li>Look professional.</li>
<li>Display news feed.</li>
<li>FOR Mr.Leung (real life client) TO inform the deadline and his expectations
for the photos.</li>
<li>FOR photographers in the yearbook club TO learn how to take good photos.</li>

<p>We pick this flowchart here because this one compared to the other ones we
made is simpler and does not involve a lot of clicking or going through a lot
of pages or coast some time. It is very straight forward that the client and
what we want. To make this website clean and simple. </p>

<h3>Problems</h3>
<ul>
<li>Why would Mr. Kang need this webpage instead of uploading it on moodle?</li>
<li>WHat is the purpose of this page?</li>
<li>How can this help Mr.Kang?</li>
<li>Why would Mr. Leung need a separate website to display those information?
Why don't he use moodle?</li>

<h1> Evaluation </h1>
<p>We came up with many different ideas, we finalized our decision. We are
making a website for Mr. Kang to help him teach trig easier and people can get
access to the information easier and learn faster.</p>
<p>Mr. chiu have challenged us with different questions, and the exact purpose
of this website. Why would Mr. Kang use this page instead of using moodle?</p>
<p>Many questions and uncertainty we decide to change our topic. Mr. Leung have
provided us with some idea. We want to create a website for
yearbook</p>

<h1>Feedback</h1>
<p>clean up, make the navigator 30% to 70%. The page now seem to unbalanced does
  not look good.<p>
    <p>Changing the storyboard to a working prototype, use firework slice up
      everything you would want to include in the prototype. Then export the sliced
      images.</p>
