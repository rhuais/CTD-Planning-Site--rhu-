<!DOCTYPE><html><head>  <title>Group Project #2</title></head><body>  <h1><center><ins><mark>Group Project #2: Yearbook</ins></center></mark></h1>  <h3><ins>Decision</ins></h3>  <p>Originally we were working on a website dedicated for trigonometry, for the math department in AIS. After carful evaluation and discussing with Mr. Chiu and our team mates we decide to change the topic for the website. Overall with the existence of online textbook and Moodle the website for trigonometry seem to be useless. So after talking with our client we developed a project together, a website for Yearbook Club in AIS.</p>  <h3><ins>What?</ins></h3>  <p>This project we are about to design a website for the yearbook club, that would be a better communication tools compared with Facebook. It would display due dates, assignments along with good and bad examples of photography. Our client Mr. Leung felt that the Facebook page for the yearbook club is not organized, it takes a long time to have access of the previous information since there were too many news feed on the page. It would take a long time to scroll down and find the needed information. By making a separate page for the club it would also be useful it there were like a photography lessons to give the photographers a guide line and some examples to follow.</p>  <h3><ins>MAP<ins></h3>    <ul>      <li>M-For yearbook club an organized website</li>      <li>A-Club members of the photography team</li>      <li>P-Inform deadlines and guides</li>    </ul>    <h3><ins>Objectives</ins></h3>    <ol>      <li>FOR Mr. Leung (real life client) TO inform the deadline and his expectations for the photos.</li>      <li>FOR photographers in the Yearbook Club TO learn how to take good photos.</li>    </ol>    <a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/1Cw512dHw2mNKwkjKIf1158dL32RrSSV3nJtBH1kmu_k/pub"><h3><ins>Success Criteria</ins></h3></a>    <a href="https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1MIZvdtcukYFilIE_l67pvsC5dlm-Ezcjdflq9swqgEM/pubhtml"><h3>To-do List</h3></a>    <h3><ins>Flowcharts/Storyboard</ins></h3>    <ul>      <li><a href="Flowchart ideas.html"><h4>Ideas</h4></a></li>      <li><a href="final flow1.html"><h4>Final flowchart</h4></a></li>    </ul>    <h3><ins>Wireframe and Storyboard Design<ins></h3>      <ul>        <li><a href="docs/wireframe.png"><h4>Wireframe Version 1</h4></a></li>        <li><a href="docs/wireframe version 2.png"><h4>Storyboard on FW</h4></a></li>        <li><a href="index DW.html"><h4>Storyboard on DW</h4></a></li>        <li><a href="wireframe sub.html"/><h4>Wireframe Design for Template</h4></a>        </ul>        <h3><ins>Making a template on DW</ins></h3>        <p>We are making three subpages, instead of making every page differently we are going to create a template on DW. To create every sub-pages separately it cost too much time and effort while achieving little effect. The alternative solution is to create a template file, then based on that file to create other sub-pages from the dwt file.</p>        <p><b>How to change the background on DW for the website?</b></p>        <p>Go to the bottom of DW and go to page properties to set either the color or insert an image for the background for DW page. On the subpage need to have the school logo, tittle and three subpages including the calendar, lessons, assignments and calendar as the client requested before.</p>        <ins><h3>Look and Feel</h3></ins>        <p>Simplicity is the key element our website should focus on. The website should          attract attention to one specific area, by using few colors instead of complex          color design. It should draw their attention to one place, which is the main          information box in the center. We chose blue as our major tone and the font is the default font          or any fonts that are simple, standard. We chose blue because it does not give a strong impression to the audience. It is easy to work with, we could use black or white for the font color. It would give a strong contrast to different area. Generally speaking blue color does not make your eyes that tired compared with red of yellow. It is easy to read, attracts attention. Plus when inserting picture, it shows contrast between the background and you could see the picture clearly. Similar with the white background color yet it is not that boring. So we choose a wallpaper with blue skies and white clouds as our background. We want the website to look simple and intersting, not boring due to the simplicty but more easy and comfortable to access information on this website.</p>          <ins><h3>Sub-Pages</h3></ins>          <ul>            <li><a href="docs/other pics/Template.png"><h4><ins>Template Design</ins></h4></a></li>            <li><a href="Sub design.html"/><h4>All Sub-Pages Design</h4></a></li>            <li><p>The navigation bar will be on the top, and throughout all the subpages the navigation bar should have a consistent look and stay the same to show they are sub-pages. Originally we would like to put the information about good and bad photography on one sub-page. With the client's feedback and knowing the great amount of information that the webpage need to include. We decided to create two more pages on the sub-page Good vs. Bad Photography. One page only focus on good examples and then the other page should only include information about bad examples. This allows the audience find information more convenient and easy to access. We think that the Good vs. Bad Photography button on the top right hand corner along with a drop down menu would keep information in to category so that the audience could understand and have access to the information easier.</p></li>          </ul>          <ins><h3>Updated objectives</h3></ins>          <ol>            <li>FOR Mr. Leung (real life client) TO inform the deadline and his expectations for the photos.</li>            <li>FOR photographers in the yearbook club TO learn how to take good photos.</li>            <li>FOR yearbook photographers TO know the dates of the events on the calendar page.</li>            <li>FOR the photographers TO understand the important elements in good and bad photos and why or how could they improve it. </li>          </ol>          <ins><h3>Updated M.A.P.</h3></ins>          <p>The main message of this website is to inform the yearbook members assignments due date. Our audience will be the Yearbook club photographers, main purpose of this website would be to help the photographers to have a place to check their            assignments and relevant due dates for the yearbook club. Also this would be a            place where new members of the yearbook club could learn the difference between            good and bad photos.</p>            <h3><ins>Updated Flowchart</ins></h3>            <img src="docs/other pics/updated flowchart.png"/>            <a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/1yr2rbImGZrKgzVt5e98uR5WARCBdpmguB1C-wnra5SY/pub"><h3>Sitemap List</h3></a>            <h3><ins>Navigation Elements</ins></h3>            <ul>              <li>As mentioned before we want the navigation to be on the top right hand on the webpage.</li>              <li>We created a version on Fireworks and import it on Dreamweaver. Overall speaking we would like to use the button we designed on Fireworks in our final product. Because it is easy to work with and have the hover effect we wanted. We could adjust it easily, since Fireworks main advantage as a program is the excellent quality of the picture it can work with.</li>              <li>We need to create:</li>              <ol>                <li>button for assignments</li>                <li>button for good and bad photography</li>                <li>button for calendar</li>              </ol>              <li>Research</li>              <ul>                <li><a href="http://www.nngroup.com/articles/tabs-used-right/">Tabs, Used Right (Article)</a></li>                <li>Most of the websites we are exposed to use buttons and checkboxes are used incorrectly. The use of tabs should provide a clear a simple way to predict and select the content. If there are no clear distinctions between groups then it is likely the tabs are used incorrectly. </li>                <li><a href="http://www.pickthebrain.com/blog/8-design-usability-principles-you-can-apply-to-your-website/">8 Design & Usability Principles (Article)</a></li>                <ol>                  <li>Think Like a User as you Design, in the end we are not the main target of the website. We really have to think clearly who are the audiences, the people that will visit this website.</li>                  <li>Choose Load Speed over Pizzazz, I think this point don't really apply for us now. But it did remind us not to put unnecessary information or graphics on the website.</li>                  <li>Anticipate Their Questions and Answer Them, this is the reason that we develop a website for. We are trying to solve to problem of the client and the audiences. People come to this website for a reason, if the website does not contain the information then the website does not meet its purpose and message. Try to let the visitor to answer these questions when visiting your site.</li>                </ol>                <ul>                  <li>What action can I take here?</li>                  <li>Why benefit if there in taking this action?</li>                  <li>How can I take this action?</li>                </ul>                <li>Follow Conventional Rules for Navigation, don't make users have to think about how your site so they can be thinking about your offers, content, etc.</li>                <li>Design to Demographics, design your website for your audience. The website should be focused.</li>                <li>Keep it Straightforward and Uncluttered, simplicity is the key. You don not want to distract your audience. Clean pages, crisp large headlines and text that can be quickly scanned is a much more productive page and serves its purpose.</li>                <li>Write for a Web Audience, wordiness should be eliminated. Write clearly and with easy english allows the reader to quickly scan text. And make shorter paragraphs with subheadings allow the website to be a more sufficient tool.</li>                <li>Constantly Test Changes and Keep Changing Till You Get It Optimized, test early and test often. Constantly testing to achieve a better website for the users.</li>              </ul>              <li>The buttons we want to create should be in the same series fo color with the background of the website, maybe it should be darker than the background. To show contrasts between the background and the buttons.</li>              <li><a href="website/Button copy/Button5final.html">Button created on Fireworks</a></li>              <li><a href="eample FW button.html">FW buttons linked</a></li>              <ul>                <li>Create small box on Fireworks canvas. Change the background of the box that will become a button later. Then we add the effect using the filter button at the bottom of Fireworks. We use inner Bevel to make it look realistic as if the box is popping upward. Then we convert the box to a symbol as button. Then we can just drag and drop to make more buttons. Then we add the effects of up and over and down separately by editing in one button. After acieving the desire effects, then export it as an html file with all the sliced up images in one folder. So it would organized and easy to find. In Dreamweaver import Fireworks object then just simply link every button by dragging the link to the coreponding text or button.</li>              </ul>              <li><a href="button DW example.html">Button created on Dreamweaver</a></li>              <ul>                <li>I just simply created boxes with clickable links and css effect as my buttons in Dreamweaver. I simply just link all the text in html file by simply drag and link as I did the same to link the Firewoeks buttons. Then I insert a shoet section off CSS coding to make the hover effect and click effect on the html link. I insert the CSS coding before the boxes coding in the Dreamweaver split view. Then the bottons are linked together and have hover effect with the CSS code working.</li>              </ul>              <li>Compare and contrast DW and FW </li>              <ul>                <li>FW is easier to create the good looking button effect, with the pop up feel and the change in texture.</li>                <li>FW is easy to export and adjust on DW webpages or template.</li>                <li>Little bit confusing with the CSS coding in the begining, but it became fairly easy and fast. Easy to change the color of the html link.</li>                <li>The strength of DW is that it is very fast to add CSS styling to the text, the weakness is it actually take more work to add effect on the button, and linking the text could be quite confusing.</li>                <li>The strength of FW is that it is very easy and fast to create good looking buttoons with all the effect, such as hover, inner bevel. These kind of effects to make the buttons look relaistic. The weakness of FW navigation is taking more time on exporting, slicing up the images then inserting in DW again. The process can be somewhat complicated and if the folder is not saved correctly you will have some difficulty displaying the effect. Which I have experienced a little bit with the hover effect not showing on my website. Then I realize later there is some problem with inserting the object and the positions of the folder. So I think the process of inserting in DW and the need of exporting is the weakness of FW and someimes can be very frustrating and time consuming. </li>              </ul>            </ul>            <h3><ins>Problems</ins></h3>            <ul>              <li>Why would Mr. Leung need a separate website to display those information?                Why don't he use Moodle?</li>                <li>How to construct a prototype on Dreamweaver?</li>                <li>How to make a link on the planning site to pop up on a separate tab?</li>                <li>How to insert Google documents or calendar into the website?</li>                <li>How to make a drop down menu?</li>                <li>How to insert Firework button into Dreamweaver?</li>                <li>Why in DW all the sub-pages created based on the template have difficulty showing the logo and the background?</li>              </ul>              <h3><ins>Evaluation</ins></h3>              <ul>                <li>Our previous success criteria is too vague not measuring the detail of the project,                  the criteria does not follow the SMART principle. We rewrote our success criteria and rethink our objectives based on the SMART principle.</li>                  <li>We spend a lot of time and focus on the look of the website of the function that it actually needs to serve and have to meet out client's requirement.</li>                </ul>                <h3><ins>Feedback</ins></h3>                <ul>                  <li>After having a meeting with the client, many of our pervious objectives seem                    outdated. We updated our criteria to a more detailed one so it could be measured                    easily. Then our objectives need to include FOR yearbook photographers TO know                    the dates of the events on the calendar page.</li>                    <li>Clean up, make the navigator 30% to 70%. The page now seem to unbalanced, does                      not look good. The page seem very complicated.</li>                      <li>Changing the storyboard to a working prototype, use firework slice up                        everything you would want to include in the prototype. Then export the sliced images.</li>                        <li>Change the flowchart we originally have, make it look more organized and less                          distracted by the fonts, colors and different shapes.</li>                          <li>With our home page, we contacted our client Mr. Leung for some feedback. The                            client gave us suggestions of the success criteria, he suggested to be more                            specific on the multimedia and the examples part of the criteria. After showing                            the homepage, he wanted to add a calendar in the website, to remind the club                            members. He want us to focus on the calendar, the website doesn't have to be                            fancy just keep everything simple. The calendar should include all major events                            through out the school year, we could use the Google calendar schedule from                            last year and construct a calendar that shows where things were about to happen                            and when.</li>                            <li>Some people did not understand the original yearbook logo that we have, they                              don't understand what YB stands for. The screen and the website size should                              adjust a little bit. It takes too much time to see and scroll down for the                              information.</li>                            </ul>                          </body>                          </html>
