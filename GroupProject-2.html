<h3><ins>Decision</ins></h3>
<p>Originally we were working on a website dedicated for trigonometry, for the math department in AIS. After carful evaluation and discussing with Mr. Chiu and our team mates we decide to change the topic for the website. Overall with the existence of online textbook and moodle the website for tigonometry seem to be useless. So after talking with our client we developed a project together, a website for Yearbook Club in AIS.</p>
<h3><ins>What?</ins></h3>
<p>This project we are about to design a website for the yearbook club, that would be a better communication tools compared with Facebook. It would display due dates, assignments along with good and bad examples of photography.Our client Mr. Leung felt that the facebook page for the yearbook club is not organized, it takes a long time to have access of the previous information since there were too many news feed on the page. It would take a long time to scroll down and find the needed information. By making a seperate page for the club it would also be useful it there were like a photography lessons to give the photogophers a guide line and some examples to follow.</p>
<h3><ins>Original Objectives and Criteria</ins></h3>
  <ol>
  <li>FOR Mr.Leung (real life client) TO inform the deadline and his expectations for the photos.</li>
    <li>FOR photographers in the Yearbook Club TO learn how to take good photos.</li>
  </ol>

<h3><small>Ideas</small></h3>

<h4>Final flowchart</h4>
<img src="docs/other pics/flowchart final.png"/>
<p>We decide to use this flowchart because this one is much simpler and easier to follow. It does not involove a lot of clicking or going through a lot of pages. It is very simple and straight forward. The client wants the website to be simple and easy to have access, so this flowchart allows us to work towards simplicity.</p>
<a href="docs/wireframe.png"><center><h3>Wireframe</h3></a>
  <a href="docs/wireframe version 2.png"><h3>Wireframe Version 2</center></h3></a>
<p>The website mainpage serves for two purpose, one for the audience which in our
case are the students in yearbook photography team to go on the website to check
for their deadlines and assignments on the website. Originally we used many shapes,colors and fonts to make the flowchart. However along with many shapes. colors
and fonts the flowchart became confusing and does don't show the clear flow of
the website. So we recreate and reorganize the flowchart, Mr.Chiu gives some
suggestion for the flowcharts including using a simple shape that does not
indicate any meaning. Later on we recreted the wireframe on Dreamweaver, it is very different process compared to Firework.</p>
<a href="index DW.html"><center><h3>Storyboard on DW</center></h3></a>
<h3><ins>Making a template on DW</ins></h3>
<p>We are making three subpages, instaed of making every page seperatly we are going to create a template on DW.</p>
<p><b>How to change the background on DW for the website?</b> Go to the bottom of DW and go to page properties to set either the color or insert an image for the background for DW page.On the subpage need to have the school logo, tittle and three subpages including the calender, lessons, assignments and calender as the client requested before.</p>
<ins><h3>Look and Feel</h3></ins>
<p>Simplicity is the key element our website should focus on. The website should
attract attention to one specific area, by using few colors instead of complex
color design. It should draw their attention to one place which is the main
information box. We chose blue as our major tone and the font is the defalt font
or any fonts that are simple, standard and simple.</p>
<ins><h3>Sub-Pages</h3></ins>
<p>The navigation bar will be on the top, and throughout all the subpages the
navigation bar should be consistant and the same to show they are sub-pages
instead of new pages. They are related.</p>

<h3><ins>Template</ins></h3>

<a href="Sub design.html"/><h3>Design</h3></a>
<p>Originally we would like to put the information about good and bad photography
on one sub-page. With the client feedback and knowing the great amount of information that the webpage need to include. We decided to create two more pages on the sub-page Good vs. Bad Photography. One page only focus on good examples and then the other page should only include information about bad examples. This allows the audience find information more convenient and easy to access. We would like the Good vs. Bad Photography button on the top right hand corner to have a drop down menu when the house hover over the button.<p>
<h3><ins>Reflection</ins></h3>
<p>After having a meeting with the client, many of our pervious objectives seem
outdated. We updated our criteria to a more detailed one so it could be measured
easily. Then our objectives need to include FOR yearbook photographers TO know
the dates of the events on the calender page.</p>
                  <ins><h3>Updated objectives</h3></ins>
                  <ol>
                    <li>FOR Mr.Leung (real life client) TO inform the deadline and his expectations
                      for the photos.</li>
                      <li>FOR photographers in the yearbook club TO learn how to take good photos.</li>
                      <li>FOR yearbook photographers TO know the dates of the events on the calender page.</li>
                      <li>FOR the photographers TO understand the important elements in good and bad
                        photos and why or how could they improve it. </li>
                      </ol>
                      <ins><h3>Updated MAP</h3></ins>
                      <p>The main message of this website is to inform the yearbook members assignments
                        due date. Our audience will be the Yearbook club photographers, main purpose of
                        this website would be to help the photographers to have a place to check their
                        assignments and relevant due dates for the yearbook club. Also this would be a
                        place where new members of the yearbook club could learn the difference between
                        good and bad photos.</p>

                        <h3><ins>Problems</ins></h3>
                        <ul>
                          <li>Why would Mr. Leung need a separate website to display those information?
                            Why don't he use moodle?</li>
                            <li>How to construct a prototype on Dreamweaver?</li>
                            <li>How to make a link on the planning site to pop up on a separate tab?</li>
                            <li>How to insert Google documents or calender into the website?</li>
                            <li>How to make a drop down menu?</li>
                            <li>How to insert Firework button into Dreamweaver?</li>
                          </ul>
                          <h3><ins>Evaluation</ins></h3>
                          <p>Many questions and uncertainty we decide to change our topic. Mr. Leung have
                            provided us with some idea. We want to create a website for
                            yearbook</p>
                            <p>Our previous success criteria is too vague not measuring the detail of the project,
                              the criteria does not follow the SMART principle.</p>
                              <p>In DW the logo and the backgorund does not show up in the new sub-pages.</p>
                              <h3><ins>Feedback</ins></h3>
                              <p>Clean up, make the navigator 30% to 70%. The page now seem to unbalanced, does
                                not look good. The page seem very complicated.</p>
                                <p>Changing the storyboard to a working prototype, use firework slice up
                                  everything you would want to include in the prototype. Then export the sliced
                                  images.</p>
                                  <p>Change the flowcahrt we origihnally have, make it look more organized and less
                                    distracted by the fonts, colors and different shapes.</p>
                                    <p>With our home page, we contacted our client Mr. Leung for some feedback. The
                                      client gave us suggestions of the success criteria, he suggested to be more
                                      specific on the mutimedia and the examples part of the criteria. After showing
                                      the homepage, he wanted to add a calender in the website, to remind the club
                                      members. He want us to focus on the calender, the websit doesn't have to be
                                      fancy jsut keep everything simple.The calender should include all major events
                                      through out the school year, we could use the google calender schedule from
                                      last year and construct a calender that shows where things were about to happen
                                      and when.</p>
                                      <p>Some peole did not understand the orignial yearbook logo that we have, they
                                        don't understand what YB stands for. The screen and the website size should
                                        adjust a little bit. It takes too much time to see and scroll down for the
                                        information. jjo </p>
